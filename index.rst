Welcome to the DiffPy and Diffpy-CMI projects.
==============================================

.. include:: abbreviations.txt

This is an open-source project to develop python software modules for diffraction 
and the study of the atomic structure of materials.  It is the home of the Diffpy-CMI 
Complex Modeling framework, a modular software framework for robust and extensible 
modeling of diffraction data.  We welcome contributions to this project from the 
community.

The project is currently centered at `Brookhaven National Laboratory`_, a US `Department of 
Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences`_ funded laboratory. 
Many parts of the code were developed under the diffraction part of the DANSE_ project,
a software construction project funded by the `National Science Foundation`_ to provide 
data analysis software tools for neutron scattering experiments.  This project was previously
centered at Columbia University and, before that, Michigan State University.

**Developers**

The active DiffPy development team is Pavol Juhás, Kevin Knox, Xiaohao Yang, Michael McKerns, 
and Simon J. L. Billinge. Former members of the project are Chris Farrow, Emil Božin, Wenduo Zhou,
Peng Tian, Timur Davis, Jiwu Liu, and Dmitriy Bryndin.

The project is currently centered at Brookhaven National Laboratory. 
It began at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at
Michigan State University and, from there, moved to the the Department of 
Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University in the city of New York before
relocating to Brookhaven National Laboratory.


**Funding**

The DiffPy project is currently supported by Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) 
Program 12-007 (Complex Modeling) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Previous funding was provided by the Distributed Data Analysis of Neutron Scattering 
Experiments (DANSE) project funded by the US National Science Foundation under grant DMR-0520547. 
More information on DANSE can be found at http://danse.us. The early developments of PDFfit2 were 
funded by NSF grant DMR-0304391 in the Billinge-group, and with support from Michigan State 
University. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material
