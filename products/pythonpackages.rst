Python Packages
===============

   **diffpy.srfit**
      Setup and control of general fitting problems, control of constraints 
      and restraints, complex structure refinement of multiple datasets.

   **diffpy.srreal**
      Python library for calculation of pair based quantities such as
      the pair distribution function (PDF), bond lengths, and bond valence
      sums from a structural model.

   **diffpy.structure**
      Handles storage of crystal structure data. Provides functions for 
      simple crystal structure operations such as calculation of distances 
      or angles from fractional coordinates as well as spacegroup expansion 
      and generation of symmetry constraints on atomic positions. Provides
      import and export of common structure file formats.

   **diffpy.utils**
      General purpose shared utilities for the diffpy libraries.
