CMI Exchange
=============

The CMI Exchange is a collection of community developed scripts,
functions, and IPython plugins that make use of the DiffPy-CMI
framework. If you are new to DiffPy-CMI it is a great place to get
started.  If you've been working with DiffPy-CMI for a while and feel
that others would benefit from seeing your code please contribute!

For New Users
-------------

Begin by visiting the 
`CMI Exchange on github <https://github.com/diffpy/cmi_exchange>`_

As with all github projects you will see these two links in the sidebar
allowing you to clone the project in your desktop or download a zip
file:

For now simply follow the download zip link to get the entire project and
unpack the zip file to a convenient location on your machine.

If you have correctly installed the `DiffPy-CMI <index.html>`_ package you can start
running the scripts right away!  You'll notice that there are two
directories: ``cmi_plugins`` and ``cmi_scripts``.  The scripts are
standalone python scripts that can be run directly from the IPython 
command line, whereas the plugins are a set of functions and IPython
extensions that provide additional functionality to your IPython
session.

Contribute Scripts
------------------

To contribute your own script to the CMI Exchange you must first fork
the project on github.  Once you've added your own code you can issue a
pull request. 

If you're new to git and don't know what it means to fork a project
`begin here <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_.
