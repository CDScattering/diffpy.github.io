Modules developed by the DiffPy team
------------------------------------

======================      ============================================
Module                      Description
======================      ============================================
`diffpy.srfit`_             Setup and control of general fitting 
                            problems.

`diffpy.srreal`_            Python library for calculation of pair based 
                            quantities such as the pair distribution 
                            function (PDF), bond lengths, and bond 
                            valence sums.

`diffpy.Structure`_         Handles storage of crystal structure data.  
                            
`diffpy.utils`_             General purpose shared utilities for the 
                            diffpy libraries.

`pyobjcryst`_               Python bindings to the ObjCryst++ 
                            Object-Oriented Crystallographic
                            Library.

`libdiffpy`_                C++ library for calculation of PDF and 
                            other real-space quantities.

Module                      Description
======================      ============================================
`periodictable`_            Extensible periodic table of the elements 
                            with support for mass, density, and 
                            X-ray/neutron scattering information.


`libobjcryst`_              ObjCryst++, crystallographic library for C++
