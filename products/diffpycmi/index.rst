DiffPy-CMI
##########

DiffPy-CMI is our complex modeling framework. It is a highly flexible
library of Python modules for robust modeling of nanostructures in
crystals, nanomaterials, and amorphous materials.

The software provides functionality for storage and manipulation of
structure data and calculation of structure-based quantities, such as
PDF, SAS, bond valence sums, atom overlaps, bond lengths, and
coordinations. Most importantly the DiffPy-CMI package contains a
fitting framework for combining multiple experimental inputs in a single
optimization problem.

This is an early release of code that is under intense development, with
support for installation on Unix, Linux, and Macintosh machines.  The
scope and documentation of the project will evolve rapidly, but we want
to make the code available at the earliest possible date. Please make
use of the software and provide feedback and suggestions for
improvement, but please be patient and check back frequently for
updates.
