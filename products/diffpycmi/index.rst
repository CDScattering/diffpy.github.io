DiffPy-CMI
##########

DiffPy-CMI is our complex modeling framework. It is a highly flexible
library of Python modules for robust modeling of nanostructures in
crystals, nanomaterials, and amorphous materials.

This is an early release of codes that are under intense development,
with support for installation on Unix and Linux machines.
The scope and documentation will evolve rapidly, but we want to make
them available at the earliest possible date. Please make use of them
and give feedback and suggestions for improvement, but please be patient
and check back frequently for updates.
