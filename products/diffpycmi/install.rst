DiffPy-CMI installation from sources
====================================

Downloaded the most recent `DiffPy-CMI tarball
<https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy-release/releases/latest>`__
and follow the steps below.

1 Install system software
------------------------------------------------------------------------

DiffPy-CMI requires the :ref:`system software dependencies <dependencies>`
which can be installed from command line using a suitable package manager.
Here are installation commands for several supported systems.

Ubuntu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Ubuntu or other Debian-based Linux distributions use ``apt-get``::

    sudo apt-get install \
        libgsl0-dev libboost-all-dev python-dev \
        python-setuptools python-numpy python-scipy \
        python-matplotlib python-lxml ipython \
        build-essential scons git zsh

Fedora
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``yum`` for Fedora or RedHat Linux::

    sudo yum install \
        gsl-devel boost-devel python-devel \
        python-setuptools numpy scipy  \
        python-matplotlib python-lxml \
        python-ipython-notebook \
        gcc-c++ scons git zsh

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Mac OS X the system dependencies can be installed using the
`MacPorts <http://www.macports.org>`_ software manager.  A similar
package system `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_ works as well, but has
been considerably less tested with DiffPy-CMI.

For best results with MacPorts follow these tips:

* We recommend to upgrade to the `latest version of OS X
  <https://www.apple.com/osx/>`_.
* Install `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_.
  If already present, we recommend to upgrade to the latest version.
* Be patient, it may take several hours to install all the dependencies
  using MacPorts.
* Installation command may fail on the first run, but usually works
  when repeated.  See MacPorts
  `FAQ <https://trac.macports.org/wiki/FAQ#buildfails>`_
  for more help.

To install system dependencies with MacPorts, use::

    sudo port install \
        python27 py27-setuptools py27-ipython py27-lxml \
        gsl boost py27-numpy py27-scipy py27-matplotlib scons git

Make sure the MacPorts versions of IPython and Python are active by
running the following commands::

    sudo port select --set ipython ipython27
    sudo port select --set python python27


**Important:** When finished installing the Mac OS X dependencies, adjust
the shell environment so that MacPorts Python is the first in the
PATH.  This can be accomplished by adding the following line to either
of ``.profile`` or ``.zshenv`` file in your HOME directory ::

    export PATH=/opt/local/bin:${PATH}


2 Install DiffPy-CMI
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unzip the DiffPy-CMI tarball into a directory of your choice.
Execute the included :file:`install` script and follow the prompts
(replace VERSION to match the actual filename)::

   tar xzf diffpy_cmi-VERSION.tar.gz
   cd diffpy_cmi-VERSION
   ./install

That should be it.

3 Test
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Execute the included test script, which should report no warnings
nor errors::

   ./runtests.sh

If there are failures for binary tarballs, you may need to recompile
the sources by running ``./install --build``.

Remarks
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The expanded diffpy_cmi directory can be renamed or moved
to a different location and the software should still work.
The only requirement is to update the :file:`diffpy_cmi.pth`
symbolic link so it points to the new location.  This can be
done by running the ``./install`` script again or following
the steps below.

The Python interpreter must have a symbolic link pointing to the
:file:`diffpy_cmi.pth` file in one of the directories where it
looks for :file:`.pth` files.  This is normally set up by the
install script.  If that process somehow fails, the preferred
:file:`pth` directory for a single-user installation can be
found using ::

   python -c 'import site; print site.USER_SITE'

For a system-wide installation the standard :file:`pth` locations are ::

   python -c 'import site; print site.getsitepackages()'

Once the :file:`pth` directory has been established, navigate to
the base diffpy_cmi directory and create the symbolic link with ::

   ln -si $PWD/diffpy_cmi.pth /path/to/the/pth/directory/

.. note::

   It is essential to use a symbolic link.  Making a copy of the
   :file:`diffpy_cmi.pth` file will not work.

.. note::

   The installation of DiffPy-CMI is entirely contained under the
   expanded diffpy_cmi directory.  The software can be completely
   uninstalled by deleting that directory and removing the symbolic
   link.
