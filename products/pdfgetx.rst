PDFgetX3 and PDFgetN3 are command-line utilities that
extract atomic pair distribution function (PDF) from
X-ray or constant-wavelength neutron powder diffraction data.
PDFgetX3 and PDFgetN3 are easy to use, fast and convenient
for automated batch processing. The interactive mode provides complete access to all
parameters and intermediate results, as well as live-plotting feature
that helps to tune conversion parameters and visualize their effect on the results.
PDFgetX3 and PDFgetN3 are distributed together with
Python library diffpy.pdfgetx, which provides the
underlying PDF-processing functions and can be
utilized in custom PDF-conversion scripts.

*The software is free for open academic research,
but requires paid license for commercial use.*

PDFgetX3 is incorporated in the powerful end-to-end x-ray PDF analysis package
:doc:`xPDFsuite <xPDFsuite>`.
xPDFsuite is designed for flexible,
high throughput PDF analyses and contains many features for interrogating, comparing and
modeling data as well as simply doing data reduction.

The academic license for PDFgetX3 and PDFgetN3 can be obtained for free from
the `Columbia Technology Ventures`_, provided the software will
be used for open academic research.

If you plan to use the software in any other way, please contact
`Beth Kauderer <techtransfer@columbia.edu>`_ at Columbia Technology Ventures.
