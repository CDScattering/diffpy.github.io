**********************
Installation
**********************

The easist way to setup SrRietveld in your computer is to use the *easy_install* tool kit with Python.

SrRietveld will use several Diffpy libraries, including:

1. diffpy.refinementapi
#. diffpy.rietveldapi
#. diffpy.Structure:  this package need not be installed again if you have PDFgui installed. 
#. diffpy.pyfullprof
#. diffpy.pygsas
#. diffpy.srrietveld

----------
Linux
----------
For detailed installation instruments, see below.

Prerequisite

1. Python: you must have python 2.3 or later installed
#. numpy
#. scipy
#. Fullprof: fp2k must be in PATH
#. GSAS: gsas/exec must be in PATH
#. pexpect: without this package, SrRietveld is not able to use GSAS as refinement engine. 

Installation Procedure

1. Unzip and untar (e.g., tar -xzvf diffpy.package.gz) the downloaded tar balls
#. In the order of diffpy.refinemenapi, diffpy.rietveldapi, diffpy.pyfullprof,
   diffpy.pygsas,  diffpy.srrietveld, install the package as

 1. enter the directory unpacked from the tar ball
 #. execute only::
      > sudo ./setup.py install

SrRietveld will be deployed to the analysis computer of SNS' POWGEN. 

The enthusiastic testers can download the diffpy libraries from DANSE's repository at:

Prerequisite

1. Python: you must have python 2.3 or later installed on Linux
#. numpy

 1. enter the directory unpacked from the tar ball
 #. execute: 
    ``> sudo ./setup.py install``

SrRietveld is able to work on Mac computers using Intel processors 
because Fullprof has a release only to Mac with Intel processors.
The installation of SrRietveld on Mac OSX is exactly the same as the procedure for Linux.
We suggest users to download and use MacPython in Bash shell, 
rather than the Python package coming with the operating system.
