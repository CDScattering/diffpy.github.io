What is SrRietveld?
===================

SrRietveld is a highly automated software toolkit designed to simplify Rietveld 
refinement using neutron and x-ray powder diffraction data. It is designed to simplify
and automate the refinement of large numbers of datasets, such as are becoming available
from modern high-throughput powder diffractometers.  SrRietveld takes the
existing Rietveld programs, GSAS and FullProf, and wraps them in a Python 
layer allowing the Rietveld refinement process to be automated in 
creative ways. The Python wrapping allows tasks to be automated, such as the
strategy (which parameters are switched on in which order) for a single
dataset, and the automation and visualization of refinements of large numbers of datasets.

SrRietveld is the Rietveld refinement application of the NSF DMR funded 
`DANSE <http://danse.us>`_ (Distributed Data Analysis for Neutron Scattering 
Experiments) software project.


===================
Design Principles
===================

SrRietveld is developed in the Python language using object 
oriented programming (OOP) concepts. Python is extensively used in
scientific software development. It is cross-platform and suitable for fast 
development. Also there are many well designed packages for scientific 
programming and modeling, such as Matplotlib, Numpy and Scipy. The OOP design 
enables SrRietveld to be easily maintained and extended.

The philosophy of the SrRietveld design is to improve the efficiency of a 
typical work flow by controlling existing Rietveld refinement engines. A uniform
data structure is implemented in SrRietveld so that the differences in input and
output in different refinement engines will not be noticeable to the users; 
i.e., the same data can be refined using either GSAS or FullProf. Pre-written 
scripts are provided for automating common tasks, such as refining from coarse 
guesses of initial parameters, sequential refinement, etc.. It is also possible 
for advanced users to develop their own macro scripts and contribute to the 
development of SrRietveld. 

=======================
What can SrRietveld do?
=======================

The functions of SrRietveld include:

* *Automatic and user-guided Le-Bail and Rietveld refinements*
  
    Perform multi-step refinement on single experiment data sets
* *Sequential Rietveld refinement*
  
    Sequentially fit related data sets from a series of experiments
* *Examine the refinement results*
  
    Plot refinement parameters or calculated patterns at each refinement step
* *Work with different diffraction types*
  
    Analyze data from time-of-flight neutron, constant wavelength neutron, and constant wavelength X-ray diffraction experiments

=======================
Merits
=======================
* Highly automated Rietveld execution
* User-friendly and easy to learn
* Automated analysis of large data sets
* Uses conventional refinement engines, such as GSAS and FullProf
* Modular software design allowing extension by expert users
