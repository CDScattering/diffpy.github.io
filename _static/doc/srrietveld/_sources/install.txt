.. note::
   SrRietveld is written in Python and is a cross platform program. Users can install and use SrRietveld on Windows, Linux/Unix, and Mac, on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.  

******************************
Install GSAS and FullProf
******************************

GSAS and FullProf have to be installed since SrRietveld uses them as backend refinement engines. SrRietveld runs with either engine; however for the greatest functionality we recommend you install both programs.

If you already have them installed you can use your existing installation.  Otherwise you they can be separately downloaded and installed by going to the respective download websites. Follow the instructions on the following websites for a standard installation of FullProf and GSAS:

    #. FullProf - http://www.ill.eu/sites/fullprof/
    #. GSAS - https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/EXPGUI/

Please make sure GSAS and FullProf can run correctly on your
computer. For example, under Linux, *tcsh* is needed to run the *gsas*
command. On Ubuntu/Debian system, the tcsh shell can be installed with
the following command::

   sudo apt-get install tcsh

GSAS requires the *libg2c.so.0* shared library, which may not be
included with the recent system version.  This library can be
obtained from a previous Ubuntu release at
http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/libg2c0/.

More details about the GSAS installation can be found
`here <http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/programs/crystallography/software/expgui/expgui_Unix_readme.html>`_.


.. _install-on-windows:

*************************************
Installation and Setup on Windows
*************************************

Windows users can install SrRietveld with a binary installer
:file:`SrRietveld-VERSION.exe`.  Double click the file and follow
the steps in the installation wizard.

The SrRietveld program short cut icon will be placed on the desktop after the installation is finished. Double click the desktop icon the SrRietveld program should start. SrRietveld may prompt a setup dialog to initialize the setups, such as the GSAS / FullProf installation paths. 

As mentioned before, to start a refinement with SrRietveld, users have to specify the paths of refinement engines (GSAS or FullProf) in SrRietveld. SrRietveld will try to find the GSAS and FullProf executables in the computer, but user can always go to the menu *Edit->Settings* dialog to specify another location. 

.. note::
   During the installation, the Microsoft Virtual C++ Redistributable
   package will also be installed to provide the necessary dynamic-link
   libraries.

--------------------------
Install SrRietveld
--------------------------

SrRietveld is distributed in a source archive :file:`SrRietveld-VERSION.tar.gz`.

SrRietveld requires a number of dependencies (other programs) to run.
Many of these are bundled with common Linux distributions such as
Ubuntu. However, you will have to verify that you have the dependencies
installed before SrRietveld can run.  The dependencies are described in
:ref:`dependencies <dependencies>`. SrRietveld can be run with GSAS
and/or FullProf as the refinement engine.  Either one or the other must
be installed; however it is recommended to instal both.

.. note::
   Please make sure all the :ref:`dependencies <dependencies>` are
   installed before proceeding further.

SrRietveld can be installed with the following steps:

   #. Unpack the source archive file ::

         tar -zxf SrRietveld-VERSION.tar.gz
     
   #. Change to the extracted distribution directory ::

         cd SrRietveld-VERSION
     
   #. Run the included installation script ::

         sudo ./install_srrietveld.py

      This checks for required Python libraries and if present,
      it installs SrRietveld to default system location.  This requires
      root privileges as granted by the sudo command.  If sudo is not
      available, you can install to the user-writable directories by
      passing :option:`--prefix` or :option:`--install-dir` options to
      the installation script.
       
      .. note::

         With the :option:`--prefix=PREFIXDIR` option one needs to
         create directories for programs and Python files under the
         PREFIXDIR and add them to the PATH and PYTHONPATH environment
         variables.  These directories can be created as::

            mkdir -p PREFIXDIR/bin
            mkdir -p PREFIXDIR/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

         where X.Y must be replaced with the actual Python version, for
         example 2.6 for Python 2.6.

         The directories need to be added to the appropriate environment
         variables by adding the following lines to the .bashrc
         (or .profile, .zshenv as appropriate for your system shell)::
          
            export PATH="PREFIXDIR/bin:${PATH}"
            export PYTHONPATH="PREFIXDIR/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}"

         After all changes to the shell setup file are made, open a new
         terminal, if you work in the same termial, run the command::

            source ~/.bashrc

         which will take the environment changes into effect.
      

   #. Test you installation by running ::

         srrietveld

      If it is correctly installed then the SrRietveld GUI window should
      open. If the program fails to run, a detailed error message will
      appear which may help solve the problem. You may also look for
      information from other users at, or post your error message to,
      our support group at
      `srrietveld-dev <http://groups.google.com/group/srrietveld-dev>`_
      to ask for help. 
   
      Please note that GSAS and FullProf have to be installed before
      SrRietveld can run any refinement. Details of how to use
      SrRietveld can be found in the :doc:`Tutorial <tutorial>`
      section.
