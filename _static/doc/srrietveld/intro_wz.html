<p>Rietveld refinement is a process of determining accurate atomic structural
information about crystalline materials from neutron or x-ray powder diffraction.
There are a number of Rietveld computer programs available, both freeware and
commercial. What they have in common is that they require extensive interactions
with the scientist operating them because of the difficulty in converging fits of
the models to the data. They have poor convergence and there is a sharp learning
curve for using them. The codes were mostly written beginning in the 1980&#8217;s and
1990&#8217;s and are monolithic Fortran programs and it is very difficult to automate
and extend them.</p>
<p>The goal of the SrRietveld project is to mitigate these problems and make a
Rietveld program that is highly automated, easy to use, and can handle the high
data-rates at POWGEN, and other high throughput neutron and X-ray diffractometers.
There is insufficient time
and resources to write completely new, modular, Rietveld codes
within the DANSE project, so the approach in the SrRietveld project was to wrap
existing Rietveld legacy codes in Python wrappers, allowing
scripts written in Python to automate and control the execution of the existing codes.
In the SrRietveld 3.0a release we have implemented the two most popular Rietveld
programs, Fullprof and GSAS, as engines running in the Python environment.
The design includes a Rietveld API (application programming interface) which
allows users to write scripts in Python that can execute different refinement
engines. In the current release this means that the same data can be refined with
either Fullprof or GSAS, or both. In the future it will allow us to change out
the Rietveld engine with any other Rietveld legacy code, or newly written code,
and users&#8217; scripts will still be operable.</p>

<h2>SrRietveld<a class="headerlink" href="#srrietveld" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SrRietveld is an open-source crystal structure refinement user-interface (UI) for
reciprocal-space fitting of powder data, or Rietveld analysis.</p>
<p>SrRietveld is being developed as part of the DANSE software project that is
building data analysis and modeling software to make optimal use of neutron
diffraction data coming from the Spallation Neutron Source.</p>
<p>SrRietveld is reliable.  It will provide the expected features of Rietveld
analysis software, such as that provided by FullProf or GSAS, as well as features
that simplify typical and advanced usage.</p>
<p>SrRietveld is easy to use.  It will provide users with tools to set up Rietveld
refinement in relatively trivial time and launch a series of Rietveld refinement
automatically or semi-automatically until convergence, allowing complex refinement
tasks to be automated and simplified. Meanwhile, SrRietveld provides users tools
to analyze the refinement result visually.</p>
<p>In addition to providing users with ease-of-use, we wish to enable new science.
In order to satisfy ever-changing user community, extensible, non-proprietary and
supported software, such as SrRietveld, will enable innovation and empower users.</p>
<p>SrRietveld is fully extensible.  It will work by allowing the user to write
scripts in a Python-based scripting language that control and automate the
refinement process It is also then straightforward for a developer to build
simple gui&#8217;s on top of the scripts. A library of helper functions is available
to simplify common tasks.</p>
<p>The major commands available in the current release are listed below</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>supporting diffraction pattern calculation<ol class="arabic">
<li>applied to neutron time-of-flight (multiple banks), neutron constant wavelength, X-ray diffraction data;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>supporting both FullProf and GSAS as refinement engines.
Exchanging underlying refinement engine is seamless to users</li>
<li>supporting automatic/semi-automatic launched Le-Bail and Rietveld refinements on
single measurements toward final convergence<ol class="arabic">
<li>applied to neutron time-of-flight (multiple banks), neutron constant wavelength, X-ray diffraction data;</li>
<li>allowing the user to trace each parameter&#8217;s value at each refinement step for further analysis;</li>
<li>allowing the user to plot patterns of each refinement step after refinement is finished for further analysis.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>supporting sequential fitting on a series of measurements from in-situ diffraction experiment,
applied to neutron time-of-flight (multiple banks), neutron constant wavelength, X-ray diffraction data;<ol class="arabic">
<li>providing user with fast access to refined parameters and refinement result (residuals);</li>

<h3>Design principles<a class="headerlink" href="#design-principles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SrRietveld has been designed to provide users with an easy-to-use yet powerful
interface for fitting structure models to powder diffraction data.
It makes use of an object oriented, component based architecture,
which makes it highly extensible and maintainable.</p>
<p>SrRietveld is written in the Python programming language. Python features a
relaxed and friendly syntax, supports <em>write once, run anywhere</em>
portability, and has extensive libraries and modules for virtually every
task. Software codes written in a variety of programming languages can be
bound into Python, which allows them to be used together. Python is becoming
a popular choice in the scientific computation community.</p>
<p>SrRietveld is built upon RietveldAPI, which is a library of python scripts to set up,
manage and analyze Rietveld refinements.</p>
<p>General users can use pre-built scripts to quickly and easily carry out
refinements that are offered as part of the SrRietveld application. In the future,
these will be controlled through a graphical user interface, though currently
they are executed from the command line.</p>
<p>Power users can build their customized Rietveld refinements by writing high-level
scripts using SrRietveld and rietveldAPI library modules.</p>
<p>In the 1.0 Beta release, SrRietveld provides the users with a series of
command line scripts to set up, launch and analyze Rietveld refinements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="capabilities">
<h3>Capabilities<a class="headerlink" href="#capabilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SrRietveld will allow users to perform powerful refinement tasks with little effort.
Python has a friendly and powerful scripting interface that enables
SrRietveld to interact with other Python modules such as matplotlib for
plotting and pymol for structure visualization. The scripting interface to
SrRietveld allows one to easily string together a series of related Rietveld
refinements, analyze the refinement results and optionally feed the results
into other Python-enabled programs.
SrRietveld will soon be enabled to run distributed on a computer cluster
in order to deal with computationally intensive tasks
such as the analysis of data flow high throughput instruments.
Once-difficult refinement strategies, such as
parametric optimization and global optimization are also planned for a
future release. Users can also look forward to automatic Rietveld refinement
that requires a minimal amount of prior knowledge about a crystal structure.</p>
<p>SrRietveld can manage multiple fits at once.
Each fit can have multiple experimental data sets and structure models.
Fits in a sequence can call upon other fits for their starting parameters,
and configured fits can be queued to run while the user is away. All the
initial, final, and intermediate data are stored in a platform independent
project file that can be loaded on any computer.</p>
<p>SrRietveld uses the <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">matplotlib</a>
Python package for 2D plotting of data and results.
Matplotlib has a friendly interface so the user can quickly and easily view the
results of a fitting.
SrRietveld lets users plot data from a series of fits and plot it against
selected meta-data (temperature, doping, etc.).</p>

<div class="section" id="fullprof-and-gsas">
<h2>Fullprof and GSAS<a class="headerlink" href="#fullprof-and-gsas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The FullProf and GSAS programs have been mainly developed for Rietveld analysis
(structure profile refinement) of
neutron (constant wavelength, time of flight, nuclear and magnetic scattering)
or X-ray powder diffraction data
collected at constant or variable step in scattering angle 2theta.
The programs can also be used as a Profile Matching
(or pattern decomposition using Le Bail method) tool,
without knowledge of the structure.
Not all the functionalities of Fullprof and GSAS are available in SrRietveld
as the ??? functions must be implemented in the API.
Currently most of the powder diffraction functionalities, except magnetic scattering,
are implemented.
There is no support for single crystal diffraction in SrRietveld.</p>
<p>The Fullprof engine and GSAS engine wrappers, called PyFullProf and PyGSAS respectively,
can be used either directly from the Python
command line, or as part of larger and more complex software
applications.</p>
