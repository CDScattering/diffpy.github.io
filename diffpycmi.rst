DiffPy-CMI
=========

DiffPy-CMI is a highly flexible library of Python modules for carrying
out customizable structure analysis tasks from diffraction data.

Overview
========

The following modules are included in the DiffPy-CMI bundle.

   **diffpy.structure**
      Handles storage of structure data such as atomic coordinates,
      lattice parameters, etc. Provides functions for simple crystal
      structure operations such as calculation of distances or angles
      from fractional coordinates as well as spacegroup expansion and
      generation of symmetry constraints on atomic positions. Provides
      import and export of common structure file formats.
   **diffpy.utils**
      General purpose shared utilities for the diffpy libraries.
   **pyobjcryst**
      Python bindings to the ObjCryst++ Object-Oriented Crystallographic
      Library
   **periodictable**
      Extensible periodic table of the elements with support for mass,
      density, and Xray/neutron scattering information.
   **cxxtest**
      Testing framework for C++.
   **libdiffpy**
      C++ library fore calculation of PDF and other real-space
      quantities. 
   **diffpy.srreal**
      Python library for calculation of pair based quantities (PDF, bond
      lengths, bond valence sums, etc.) from a structural model.
   **diffpy.srfit**
      Setup and control of general fitting problems, control of constraints 
      and restraints, complex structure refinement of multiple datasets.
   **pycifrw**
   **cctbx**
   **pyobjcryst/libobjcryst/newmat**
   **pyobjcryst/libobjcryst/ObjCryst**
   **sans/data_util**
   **sans/sansdataloader**
   **sans/sansmodels**
   **sans/pr_inversion**
