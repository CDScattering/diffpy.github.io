<p>
To understand and
control the properties of materials it is necessary to have a
detailed knowledge of their atomic structure.  Increasingly, we are
interested in exploiting materials with complex structures on the
nanoscale, which presents special experimental challenges as
crystallography, the standard approach to structure determination,
loses its power on these length-scales.  Alternative methods
sensitive to nanoscale order are under development.  The diffraction
sub-group of the DANSE project recently released a new software tool
that will have a large impact in nanostructure characterization using
x-ray and neutron diffraction.

<p>
The diffraction data are Fourier transformed to obtain the
atomic pair distribution function (PDF) and analyzed by
quantitatively fitting nanostructure models to the data.   An example
of the tool, PDFgui [1],
is shown in the accompanying 
<a href="media/LaMnO3_nsf4.swf">flash movie</a>. 
It is being used to study the evolution of local structural
parameters through a structural phase transition.  Neutron-derived
PDFs have been collected over a temperature range from room
temperature to 880 K for the strongly correlated electron material,
LaMnO<SUB>3</SUB>.  PDFgui allows rapid setup of individual and
multiple refinements.  The first refinement  is initialized using the
intuitive gui (graphical user interface) tools, and the structure
visualized using the built-in structure visualizing tool.  At this
point the temperature-series macro is chosen allowing multiple (in
this case, 10) structure refinements to be selected and refined
automatically.  The flexible built-in plotting capabilities allows a
refined parameter to be plotted during this process as shown. The
structural phase transition is clearly visible as a cusp in this
parameter, which happens to be a thermal factor on oxygen ions in the
structure.  This program will be implemented at the POWGEN3 and NOMAD
diffractometers at SNS with macros to allow real-time parametric
refinements similar to those shown, allowing researchers to make
scientific discoveries during data collection, at the beam-time, and
not <i>a-posteriori</i> after the beamtime is over.  PDFgui has
numerous extensions, beyond those shown in the movie that are
described in more detail in Ref. [1]. 
The beta version of PDFgui is
now in public release, available for Windows, Linux and Mac OSX
platforms, and in the first month has been downloaded 220 times. More
