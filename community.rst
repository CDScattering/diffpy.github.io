Community
=========

To ensure a bright future for the DiffPy project it is essential to build a strong community 
of users and contributing developers. There are several Google groups for support and 
development of DiffPy and related applications.

- `diffpy-users <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/diffpy-users>`_ Help on usage of PDFgui, 
  PDFfit2 and other DiffPy components. This group should become a knowledge base for PDFgui 
  user tips, tricks and troubleshooting. Feel free to ask your question here.
