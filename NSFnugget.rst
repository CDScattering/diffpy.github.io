To understand and control the properties of materials it is necessary to have 
a detailed knowledge of their atomic structure. Increasingly, we are interested 
in exploiting materials with complex structures on the nanoscale, which presents 
special experimental challenges as crystallography, the standard approach to 
structure determination, loses its power on these length-scales. Alternative 
methods sensitive to nanoscale order are under development. The diffraction 
sub-group of the DANSE project recently released a new software tool that 
will have a large impact in nanostructure characterization using x-ray and 
neutron diffraction.

The diffraction data are Fourier transformed to obtain the atomic pair distribution 
function (PDF) and analyzed by quantitatively fitting nanostructure models to the 
data. PDFgui allows rapid setup of individual and multiple 
refinements. This program will be implemented at the 
POWGEN3 and NOMAD diffractometers at SNS with macros to allow real-time parametric 
refinements similar to those shown, allowing researchers to make scientific 
discoveries during data collection, at the beam-time, and not a-posteriori after 
the beamtime is over. PDFgui has numerous extensions 
that are described in more detail in [#]_. The beta version of PDFgui 
is now in public release, available for Windows, Linux and Mac OSX platforms, 
and in the first month has been downloaded 220 times. More information can be 
found at http://www.diffpy.org.
