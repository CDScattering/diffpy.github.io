We are very excited to announce the first public release of our DiffPy
Complex Modeling Initiative (DiffPy-CMI) project. This includes the
SrFit complex modeling framework, a powerful configurable extensible
program for fitting models to PDF's, small angle scattering data, and
more. The software has already been used in a number of publications
(see below), allowing fitting of small nanoparticles, molecules,
applying multiple constraints and so on.

Who should download the release?
--------------------------------

This is an early release in a series of releases.  The code is stable,
but the emphasis of our development to date hase been functionality and
not interface--it requires somewhat advanced Python scripting skills to
use. Also, the modeling capabilities are somewhat advanced. If you are a
PDF beginner or if you are not familiar with Python you may be happier
with the PDFgui program.

What platforms are supported?
-----------------------------

This release is for various flavors of 32 and 64 bit Unix/Linux and for
Mac. If you are a Windows user we ask that you please stay tuned and
wait for a future relase.

Is the software free?
---------------------

DiffPy-CMI is open source and free to use. As usual, we ask that you
cite the paper describing the program. Also, we hope that you will
contribute script templates to the CMI_Exchange for use by other members
of the community.

How do I get the code?
----------------------

Please visit diffpy.org and follow the instructions.



Please enjoy the code. As usual, post questions, problems, and requests
to the diffpy-users google group and bug-reports to the diffpy-dev or
email Prof. Billnig directly.
