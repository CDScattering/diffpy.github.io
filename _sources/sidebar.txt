This is an open-source project to develop python software for diffraction 
and the study of the atomic structure of materials.  It is the home of the 
`Diffpy-CMI <products/diffpycmi.html>`_
Complex Modeling framework, a modular software framework for robust and extensible 
modeling of diffraction data.  We welcome contributions to this project from the 
community.
