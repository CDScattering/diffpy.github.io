DiffPy-CMI
##########

DiffPy-CMI is our complex modeling framework. It is a highly flexible
library of Python modules for robust modeling of nanostructures in
crystals, nanomaterials, and amorphous materials.

This is an early release of codes that are under intense development.
The scope and documentation will evolve rapidly, but we want to make
them available at the earliest possible date. Please make use of them
and give feedback and suggestions for improvement, but please be patient
and check back frequently for updates.

Download
========
By downloading and using this software you are agreeing to the
conditions specified in `LICENSE.txt <license.html>`_ 

The current version is 1.0 and is supported on Linux and Unix platforms.
`Download version 1.0 tarball <https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy-release/releases>`_


.. _install:

Install
========

Once you've downloaded the most recent DiffPy-CMI tarball follow the
steps below to install:

#. Install the required dependences from the command line by using a
   suitable package manager.

   For Ubuntu use ``apt-get``::

    sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev libboost-all-dev \
        python-dev python-setuptools python-numpy \
        python-scipy python-matplotlib python-lxml ipython 

   For Fedora use ``yum``::

    FIXME - add command line 

#. Create a symbolic link to the diffpy-CMI directory inside the Python
   directory for user files.

   For a one-user installation determine the Python directory for user
   files, create it if it does not exist yet, and put a symbolic
   link to the diffpy-1.0.pth file inside this folder. This can be done 
   by executing the follwing code from within your diffpy-CMI directory::

    D="$(python -c 'import site; print site.USER_SITE')"
    mkdir -p "$D"
    ln -si $PWD/diffpy-1.0.pth "$D"/

   For a system-wide installation create symbolic link in the directory
   for system-wide Python packages. Again, the following code should be
   executed from within your diffpy-CMI directory::

    sudo ln -si $PWD/diffpy-1.0.pth /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

   Note that it is essential to use a symbolic link.  Making a copy of the
   pth file will not work.

#. Test the installation by running::

   ./runtests.sh

If you have successful installed the DiffPy-CMI software to your local
machine and would like to see some coding examples to get started, check
