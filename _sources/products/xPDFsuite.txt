Overview
========

This suite of algorithms and software, named xPDFsuite, converts X-ray diffraction (XRD) data into total scattering pair distribution functions by
numerically transforming XRD data from frequency space into position space. This conversion allows characterization of materials including drugs and
industrial materials in their amorphous and nanocrystalline and liquid states.

This software implements a number of recent developments in the data analysis and modeling of PDFs derived from X-ray experiments which may be carried out
at synchrotron or laboratory sources that allow for highly automated and straightforward processing. The software includes a full-featured graphical user
interface and is designed for the latest generation of studies that involve often many hundreds or thousands of datasets.  The software runs on laptops and
workstations running windows, mac OSX and linux.

Features
========

Improving upon an earlier version of the software, xPDFsuite is programmed in Python instead of IDL (Interactive Data Language), making it more portable
than its predecessor. The software also gives the user robust and reliable total scattering pair distribution functions by specifying a very small number
of input parameters.

Unlike other programs for obtaining the pair distribution function,
the software is exceptionally easy to learn and use. This increases
the range of people who can use it, decreases training costs, and
speeding up workflow. xPDFsuite also permits users to run multiple
data sets using the same input file, allowing for batch processing
in fractions of a second.

Key features:

* Full featured, easy-to-use GUI;
* Real time PDF transformation and plotting;
* Flexiable plotting and analyzing for single and mulitple data sets;
* Optimized for high throughput data processing; 
* 2D powder diffraction image integration;
* Static and dynamic mask editing on 2D image;
* Pearson correlation analysis on selected data-sets;
* Written in Python and support Windows, Linux, and MacOSX

Applications
============

* Structural characterization of crystalline, nanocrystalline, amorphous or nanoparticle materials, including inorganics, polymers and pharmaceuticals.
* materials development guidance
* Testing of compounds to ensure consistency during development
* Submission for federal agency (e.g., FDA) approval
* Patent application filing
* Intellectual property infringement defense
* Stability studies, e.g., to determine shelf lifetime of drugs

Advantages
==========

* First viable means of characterizing the structure of amorphous or nanocrystalline compounds
* Yields information that makes the development of amorphous or nanocrystalline materials much more feasible
* In contrast to earlier algorithms, the technology can compute the total scattering pair distribution function in several microseconds.
