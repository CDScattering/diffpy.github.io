To understand and control the properties of materials it is necessary to have 
a detailed knowledge of their atomic structure. Increasingly, we are interested 
in exploiting materials with complex structures on the nanoscale, which presents 
special experimental challenges as crystallography, the standard approach to 
structure determination, loses its power on these length-scales. Alternative 
methods sensitive to nanoscale order are under development. The diffraction 
sub-group of the DANSE project recently released a new software tool that 
will have a large impact in nanostructure characterization using x-ray and 
neutron diffraction.

The diffraction data are Fourier transformed to obtain the atomic pair distribution 
function (PDF) and analyzed by quantitatively fitting nanostructure models to the 
data. An example of the tool, PDFgui [1], is shown in the accompanying flash movie. 
It is being used to study the evolution of local structural parameters through a 
structural phase transition. Neutron-derived PDFs have been collected over a 
temperature range from room temperature to 880 K for the strongly correlated 
electron material, LaMnO3. PDFgui allows rapid setup of individual and multiple 
refinements. The first refinement is initialized using the intuitive gui (graphical 
user interface) tools, and the structure visualized using the built-in structure 
visualizing tool. At this point the temperature-series macro is chosen allowing 
multiple (in this case, 10) structure refinements to be selected and refined 
automatically. The flexible built-in plotting capabilities allows a refined 
parameter to be plotted during this process as shown. The structural phase transition 
is clearly visible as a cusp in this parameter, which happens to be a thermal 
factor on oxygen ions in the structure. This program will be implemented at the 
POWGEN3 and NOMAD diffractometers at SNS with macros to allow real-time parametric 
refinements similar to those shown, allowing researchers to make scientific 
discoveries during data collection, at the beam-time, and not a-posteriori after 
the beamtime is over. PDFgui has numerous extensions, beyond those shown in the 
movie that are described in more detail in Ref. [1]. The beta version of PDFgui 
is now in public release, available for Windows, Linux and Mac OSX platforms, 
and in the first month has been downloaded 220 times. More information can be
